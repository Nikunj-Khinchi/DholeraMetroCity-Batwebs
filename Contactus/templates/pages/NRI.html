A person resident in India who is a citizen of Pakistan or Bangladesh or Sri Lanka or Afghanistan or China or Iran or Nepal or Bhutan is governed by the provisions of the Foreign Exchange Management (Acquisition and Transfer of Immovable Property in India) Regulations, 2000. He would require prior approval of the RBI for acquisition and transfer of immovable property in India even though he is resident in India. Such requests are considered by the RBI in consultation with the Government in India.<br><br>

Indian regulators are known to modify laws and regulations with nagging frequency. The best of investments decisions suffer due to sudden swings in regulations. The provisions related to foreign investment in real estate in India have been relatively stable and no pejorative changes have been effected therein in the recent past. That has perhaps facilitated the aggressive alteration of India’s skyline, due to large and outstanding building projects funded interalia, by foreign funds. It has not yet fully addressed the backlog of deficit in demand for space. Such long term deficit will always attract investment therein and returns will follow. So will NRIs.

     Acquisition of immovable property in India by persons resident outside India (foreign national) is regulated in terms of section 6 (3) (i) of the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA), 1999 as well as by the regulations contained in the Notification No. FEMA 21/2000-RB dated May 3, 2000, as amended from time to time.

Person resident outside India is categorized as Non- Resident Indian (NRI) or a foreign national of Indian Origin (PIO) or a foreign national of non-Indian origin.

      <br><br> (iv) the original deed of settlement and a tax clearance / No Objection Certificate from the Income-Tax Authority should be produced for the remittance <br><br>(v) Where the remittance as above is made in more than one installment, the remittance of all such installments shall be made through the same Authorised Dealer<br><br> (vi) In case of a foreign national, sale proceeds can be repatriated if the property is inherited from a person resident outside India with the prior approval of the Reserve Bank.

     The general permission for repatriation of sale proceeds of immovable property is not available to a citizen of Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, China, Afghanistan and Iran and he has to seek specific approval of the Reserve Bank.
     <br><br>
     As FEMA, 1999 specifically permits transactions only in Indian Rupees with citizens of Nepal and Bhutan. Therefore, the question of repatriation of the sale proceeds in foreign exchange to Nepal and Bhutan would not arise.
